Yup, this sure is yet another blog. I'm toying with this as a location for
posts that don't fit neatly into either [psych0tik.blog](1) or the
[99designs tech-blog](2) where I've also been known to write.

For some idea of what to expect here, I'm big on:

* Abusing Ruby
* LISP, specifically scheme, generally chicken scheme
* Building cool shit on the internet
* Distributed things

And I generally push these hairbrained schemes to my [github profile](3)
